Hospital Management 







In this project, we have created a hospital management website that includes registration (through form filling) and storing the details of patients into a database. This database
is only accessible either by an administrator or receptionist. The interface we have developed is simple and very user friendly. The website consist of various pages like: Home,
Aboutus , Services , Contact us. A backend database is added using xampp. The user has to enter their details to get an appointment at the hospital through the form present on home page. This information gets stored in a database and registration successful is shown as a result. 
The languages used are:

•	HTML
